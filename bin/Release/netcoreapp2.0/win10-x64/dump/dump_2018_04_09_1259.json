        "abstractTxt": "High-density lipoproteins (HDL) are considered to protect against atherosclerosis in part by facilitating the removal of cholesterol from peripheral tissues. However, factors regulating lipid efflux are incompletely understood. We previously identified a variant in adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter A8 (ABCA8) in an individual with low HDL cholesterol (HDLc). Here, we investigate the role of ABCA8 in cholesterol efflux and in regulating HDLc levels.",

        "abstractTxt": "Tetrahydrolipstatin (THL) is bactericidal but its precise target spectrum is poorly characterized. Here, we used a THL analog and activity-based protein profiling to identify target proteins after enrichment from whole cell lysates of Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin cultured under replicating and non-replicating conditions. THL targets α/β-hydrolases, including many lipid esterases (LipD, G, H, I, M, N, O, V, W, and TesA). Target protein concentrations and total esterase activity correlated inversely with cellular triacylglycerol upon entry into and exit from non-replicating conditions. Cellular overexpression of lipH and tesA led to decreased THL susceptibility thus providing functional validation. Our results define the target spectrum of THL in a biological species with particularly diverse lipid metabolic pathways. We furthermore derive a conceptual approach that demonstrates the use of such THL probes for the characterization of substrate recognition by lipases and related enzymes.",
